This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug occurs because the loop iterates one time too many, trying to access an index that does not exist. The solution shows how to fix the bug by changing the loop condition to iterate up to, but not including, the array's length.
